# sdk.move_cube

Status: **planned specification; not implemented**. Work item: **PR-005 — Authenticated local Python SDK**.

Dependencies: PR-003. Validation lanes: cpu.

## Behavior and scope

Implement only the named behavior, its public contract, corresponding runnable example and directly required tests/docs. Split the item before execution if it cannot be reviewed as one behavior.

Use a tiny deterministic fixture with seed 7, generated locally or covered by an explicit asset license manifest. Exercise the public command/query interfaces once available, avoiding privileged test-only mutation paths.

## Proposed run command

This command becomes available only when this work item is implemented:

```sh
omniweft_examples --example sdk.move_cube --headless --seed 7 --verify --output artifacts/sdk.move_cube
```

## Pass criteria

Negotiate protocol, create/move/query an object through a separate Python process, and receive typed receipts.

## Negative and recovery cases

Missing/wrong token, forbidden Origin, incompatible version and an expired session cannot mutate the world.

Use independently authored expected fixture values and preserve minimized repro inputs when a check fails. If a numerical tolerance is needed, name the fixture, units, timestep/device, threshold and reason before running; do not choose it after seeing a failure.

## Evidence and completion

Record exact candidate SHA, commands, environment, seed, assertions, results, artifact hashes and limitations using docs/templates/EVIDENCE.md. See the [evidence template](../docs/templates/EVIDENCE.md). A screenshot alone cannot pass the feature. Missing required lanes are `not_run`, and prevent a complete claim for that lane.

Revert the PR; preserve source fixtures and earlier save data. Any persistent schema change needs a versioned migration and recovery fixture before merge.

Update this document with actual build/run instructions and observed evidence when the implementation merges. The [roadmap](../docs/ROADMAP.md) and [backlog](../planning/backlog.json) retain the same work-item and example IDs.
